Hi! Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for coming.
--

== Who we are

include::rodrigo.adoc[]

include::paul.adoc[]


== Who are you?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Before we start, a quick show of hands.

* How many people know Kotlin?
* Who has a good grasp of the Gradle Groovy DSL?
* Who has a good grasp of the Gradle Kotlin DSL?
--


== IDE support

- IntelliJ IDEA
- Eclipse Buildship

[NOTE.speaker]

== Pleasant authoring experience?

[NOTE.speaker]

*Rodrigo*

=== Quickness

[%step]
* Quick feedback
** the IDE helps, suggests, type-checks
* Quick access to documentation
* If it gets to that, quick access to source

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Rodrigo*

Effectivness with minimum effort
--

=== Quickness

*DEMO*

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Rodrigo*

- `hello-world` sample
- suggestions
- type-checking
- documentation & source
--

=== Low cognitive overhead

[%step]
- You feel in control, never helpless
- Discoverability of the dynamic model

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Paul*

- How many things you have to keep in mind to understand the context
- Offload all this context because the IDE will be here to help you
- Find the information you need *when* you need it
- Important with a dynamic model such as Gradle where plugins contribute
--

=== Low cognitive overhead

*DEMO*

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Rodrigo*

- `what-is-group` sample
- `application` plugin & its extension
--

== Organizing build logic

[%step]
- To take the most advantage of the IDE
- With as less ceremony as possible

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Paul*

- Only simple examples for now but in reality build logic is complex
- Tools managing this complexity
--

=== Organizing build logic

*DEMO*

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Share a function
- Share a task type
- Authoring Gradle plugins
--


== Disclaimer

*We're not there yet!*

[%step]
- Asynchronous build script classpath resolution from IDEs
- Build logic organization refactorings in IDEs
- Better contextual suggestions in IDEs
- etc..

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- *Rodrigo* intro - goodness avail. today - more goodness avail. tomorrow
- *Paul* making sure users are never blocked - async IDE
- *Rodrigo* build logic refactorings
- *Paul* suggestions
- *Rodrigo* etc..
--


== Challenges

[%step]
- Make the goodness available in all major IDEs

- Being able to write `settings.gradle.kts`

- Being able to write init scripts in Kotlin

- Making the plugins from the plugin portal discoverable from the IDE

- Better bridging across plugins written with only Groovy in mind

- Moving away from the `buildscript` block

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Paul*

- IDE: public apis and models
- plugin portal support on par with built-in plugins
--


== How does it work?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Rodrigo*
--

[%notitle]
=== Without an IDE

image::build.svg[background, size=contain]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Rodrigo*
--

[%notitle]
=== From an IDE

image::ide.svg[background, size=contain]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Rodrigo*
--


== What's next?
[%step]
* *Deprecate the `buildscript` block in favor of the `plugins` block*
[%step]
** Allow plugins to declare api dependencies
** Allow script plugins to declare plugin dependencies
** Allow to apply script plugins from the `plugins` block
** Make community plugins available inside corporate environments
** Make the `plugins` block work across included builds in a composite build

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Paul*

- high on the list of our priorities
- any contribution to the dynamic model is taken into account
--

=== What's next?
* Deprecate the `buildscript` block in favor of the `plugins` block
* *Streamline build logic organization*
[%step]
** Kotlin compiler plugins (allopen, ???)
** Share external plugin configuration code

[NOTE.speaker]
--
*Rodrigo*
--

=== What's next?
* Deprecate the `buildscript` block in favor of the `plugins` block
* Streamline build logic organization
* *Documentation*
[%step]
** Kotlin DSL API documentation
*** https://gradle.github.io/kotlin-dsl-docs/api/
** Kotlin snippets in the Gradle user manual and guides

*Paul*

- As we approach the 1.0 release we think this is the right time
- Confident that the DSL and IDE integration are in good shape
- It's a good time for you to provide your feedback to influence 1.0
